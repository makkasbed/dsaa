## Data Structures and Algorithms
This repo contains the various implementation of the data structures and algorithms class at UG.
The following problems have been implemented:

- Coin Row Problem(Maximization problem)
- Change Making Problem(Minimization Problem)
- Coin Collecting Problem(Maximization Problem)
- Knapsack Problem(Maximization Problem)

The implementation were all done in Java and can be found under the **problems** package.

The reference book is **Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms** by **Anany Levitin**

The chapters are:
 - Chapter 8.1
 - Chapter 8.2
 - Chapter 9
